## ðŸ¤” What is the fibonacci sequence?

Excerpt from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence):

>In mathematics, the **Fibonacci numbers**, commonly denoted $F_n$, form a sequence, the **Fibonacci sequence**, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors start the sequence from 1 and 1 or sometimes (as did Fibonacci) from 1 and 2. Starting from 0 and 1, the first few values in the sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144.
