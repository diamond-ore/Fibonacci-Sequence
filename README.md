## üåÄ What is the fibonacci sequence?

Excerpt from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence):

>In mathematics, the **Fibonacci numbers**, commonly denoted $F_n$, form a sequence, the **Fibonacci sequence**, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors start the sequence from 1 and 1 or sometimes (as did Fibonacci) from 1 and 2. Starting from 0 and 1, the first few values in the sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Naming & Directories

The name of your file should just be `Fibonacci` or `fibonacci` (case doesn't really matter) along with the proper file extension, please create a directory named after the programming language you're writing it in and store it's respective directory (e.g. `JavaScript` --> `J/JavaScript`, `C#` --> `C/C#`). If there is no folder being the starting letter of your language's name, then create one, as long as its starting with a character in the latin alphabet. Otherwise, put it in the `#` directory (e.g. `„Éó„É≠„Éá„É´`, `0 (nop^)`)

If necessary, use abbrevations, but only if the name is too long (i.e. abbreviate `Cascading Style Sheets` to `CSS`, but not `JavaScript` to `JS`)

If a file name contains a special character that Windows is not able to display, substitute it with the following:
